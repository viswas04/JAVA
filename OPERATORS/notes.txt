In Java, operators are special symbols or keywords that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands and return a result. They are essential for performing arithmetic calculations, logical comparisons, assignments, and manipulating data within Java programs.

Types of Java Operators

Arithmetic Operators

Perform basic mathematical operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%) which gives the remainder.

Examples:

+ Addition

- Subtraction

* Multiplication

/ Division

% Modulus

Unary Operators

Work with a single operand to increment (++), decrement (--), negate (-), or invert boolean values (!).

++ Increment (pre and post)

-- Decrement (pre and post)

+ Unary plus

- Unary minus

! Logical NOT

Assignment Operators

Used to assign values to variables and can combine assignment with arithmetic operations:

= Simple assignment

+=, -=, *=, /=, %= Compound assignments

Relational Operators

Compare two values and return a boolean result:

== Equal to

!= Not equal to

> Greater than

< Less than

>= Greater than or equal to

<= Less than or equal to
